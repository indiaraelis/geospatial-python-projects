# 🛰️ Geospatial Python Projects

This repository showcases my experience working with geospatial data using Python. All scripts are based on real-world applications from my time as a research intern at Geolab (UDESC), where I focused on database modeling, remote sensing, and geospatial analysis.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- RasterIO
- GeoPandas
- NumPy
- PostgreSQL / PostGIS
- Scikit-learn
- SQLAlchemy

## 📁 Project List
