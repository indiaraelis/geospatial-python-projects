# Flood Risk Map

This script models flood risk by combining flood zone data with population density to identify vulnerable areas.

## Requirements

- geopandas
- matplotlib

## Usage

1. Replace `'flood_areas.geojson'` and `'population_density.geojson'` with your own data.
2. Run the script to visualize flood risk and affected population.
